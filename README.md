JeoGongTong is an app that provides an environment to study for people who do not have an environment to study or have difficulty studying on their own.

## 🐽  Introduction
Studying has become a key component of society throughout history. Nevertheless, there are many people who have difficulty learning due to environmental or personal factors. In order to overcome these problems, the low-common app offers new solutions. The app promotes learning motivation by providing a space for people who share the same goal to study together. It gives learning fun through a game-like tier and ranking system, and interactions through questionnaires help students understand what they are learning without a teacher.<br/>

Through JeoGongTong, society gains important benefits that can improve accessibility and efficiency of education. I hope that the learning environment provided by low-common will realize the joy of learning and improve the educational environment of society as a whole.
